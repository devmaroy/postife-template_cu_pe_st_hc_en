## Structure ##

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in my project.

    .
    ├── favicon
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── screenshot.png
    ├── yarn.lock
    └── readme.md

<br>

1.  **`/favicon`**: This directory contains favicon files.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the neccessary files such as scss styles and js.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies that were installed for project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

5.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for project.

6.  **`readme.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about project.
